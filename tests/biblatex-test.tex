该文档用于测试 biblatex 编译

This is a test document to demonstrate BibTeX.

We can cite Lamport's work \cite{lamport1986latex} as well as Knuth's \TeX~book \cite{knuth1986texbook}.

\section{Introduction}
This is a test document to demonstrate multiple citations using BibLaTeX.

In this section, we will cite several references at once. For example, we can cite both Leslie Lamport's \LaTeX~book \cite{lamport1986latex} and Donald Knuth's \TeX~book \cite{knuth1986texbook}. 

We can also cite multiple references in one command. Here are some examples:

% 引用多本书籍和文章
Here is a citation of multiple works: \cite{lamport1986latex, knuth1986texbook, latexcompanion}.

% 在不同的上下文中引用不同类型的文献
Another example with various types of sources: \cite{article1, phdthesis1, techreport1, website1}.

\subsection{Further Reading}
For further reading on advanced topics, see \cite{phdthesis1} for detailed research or \cite{techreport1} for technical insights.

If you want to explore online resources, check out \cite{website1}.

\section{Conclusion}
To summarize, multiple citations can be used in various ways throughout your document. You can mix and match books, articles, theses, and online sources freely depending on your needs.
